I had tried to do it myself many months ago but stopped due to the stress. Karl made the process of building the website and the automation structure feel effortless. He explained how various features worked using laymen language and was always ready to join a call to answer any queries I had. I found the frequent update videos showing off a new feature he had coded very useful, and I felt consistently updated.<br><br>I would highly recommend Karl's services no matter the size of your business as he will scale the features you need to match your budget. I look forward to working with Karl in the future.<b>"</b></p>

          <h1 class="display-5 fw-bold text-white lh-1 mb-3 ps-2 new-rocker-regular">The Plan</h1>
          <p class="lead">Below are some of the ideas I came up with to make this site not just work, but make it special.</p>
          <h3 class="new-rocker-regular">Stripe and Sendgrid</h3>
          <p class="lead">My idea was simple. Purchases are made through a Stripe gateway. Here the customer will enter their email address. The server would then use a stripe webhook to get this address upon successful checkout. Then, I use Sendgrid to send an email to the customer with the link to access the digital product. The code for sending the email is included at the end of the stripe webhook. This way, the email is sent to the customer after every successful checkout, leaving emailing proccess completely automated.</p>
          <h3 class="new-rocker-regular">Brand</h3>
          <p class="lead">I also went and created a logo and colour scheme for Max's new website. The various green colours give the appropriate atmosphere for a biology based grinds school. I also liked how bootstrap's components looked modern and sleek, which also was inline with the site's feel of a professional science school. Creating this new brand scheme prsents many more oppertunities for my client to grow his online presence, using this scheme to generate email templates later down the line to create better looking emails.I also offered to and did create unique collages of his notes to display as the product images in the stripe gateways and for the product pages on the site itself.</p>
          <h3 class="new-rocker-regular">Google Drive</h3>
          <p class="lead">I set up my own Google Drive where I uploaded videos to showcase when a major update of the site was ready. This allowed the client to see for themselves the progress being made, and allowed him to leave comments about things he may want changed or thinks he wanted to keep.          </p>
